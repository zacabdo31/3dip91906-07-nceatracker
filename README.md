# 3dip91906-07-nceatracker
A digital tool that allows students to manage and track their NCEA results throughout the current school year. Each student can have their own personal space to record internal and external assessments, track credits, and monitor progress toward achieving NCEA Level 1, 2, or 3.


The NCEA Assessment Tracker helps students stay organised and motivated by providing a clear visual overview of their academic progress. Users can:
Add subjects and assessments
Record achieved credits and grades (Achieved, Merit, Excellence)
View total credits and progress toward endorsements
Track deadlines for upcoming internals

This project was developed as part of the NCEA Level 3 Digital Technologies standards (AS91906 & AS91907) to demonstrate the use of complex programming techniques and digital outcome development.
